        <description>The Web Services folder contains WSDL files used by business processes. Typical sub-folders to the Web Services folder are “Abstract” which 
contain the WSDL files that do not contain the end-point binding and “Concrete” which do. This folder and its sub-folders contain both the WSDL 
files that describe the services exposed by the current project as well as WSDL files for external services which are invoked by the current project.</description>
